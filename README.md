# Auto-Commit Bot ðŸ¤–

This repository automatically commits daily updates using GitHub Actions to simulate daily activity. The bot updates a simple text file (`last_update.txt`) every day with the current date.

### How it works:
- The bot runs at 00:00 UTC every day.
- It updates the file `last_update.txt` with the latest date.
- Automatically commits and pushes the changes, keeping the repo active.

### Why?
This project is designed to demonstrate how you can automate updates to a repository and maintain a consistent GitHub activity log.
